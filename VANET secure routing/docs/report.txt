Title: Secure VANET Routing Protocol â€“ NS-3 + Python Simulation Report

Objective:
To simulate a secure VANET routing scenario using NS-3 for network simulation and Python for message integrity verification using cryptographic hashing.

Tools Used:

NS-3 (C++) for simulating vehicle nodes and message exchange

Python 3 (matplotlib, pandas, hashlib) for post-analysis and tamper detection

Linux (Kali VM)

Methodology:

Simulated 3 vehicle nodes using WiFi ad-hoc mode in NS-3.

Each node broadcasted UDP packets.

Packet logs (timestamp, size, etc.) were written to messages.csv.

Python script simulated hashing using SHA256, SHA3_256, MD5, etc.

Tampering was introduced randomly to test integrity detection.

Graphs plotted hash performance and vehicle behavior.

Results:

All tampered messages were successfully detected via hash mismatch.

Graphs (hash_times.png, vehicle_speeds.png, vehicle_positions.png) demonstrate secure transmission and analysis.

Conclusion:
This hybrid simulation demonstrates how cryptographic hashes can protect VANET messages against tampering. NS-3 provided realistic network simulation, while Python enabled security analysis.
